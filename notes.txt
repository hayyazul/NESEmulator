1. It might be helpful to describe what the first opcodes executed from nestest.nes should be.
2a. If you are having issues with your CPU going onto non-program data,
first check if your data is being loaded in correctly. 

After this, check if your PC is being iterated the correct amount (i.e., an instruction which is 
3 bytes long should not have its PC iterate by any amount besides 3 unless...)

2b. If the above is correct, check the instructions which modify the PC. The reasoning is this: 
Under normal circumstances, a PC should not increment onto an invalid opcode, so if the increments 
are correct as checked in (2a), then the issue must lie in the above mentioned instructions.

3. Use a disassembler as reference.

4. Note related to the project directly, but I've noticed using pointers allows for more flexibility. For example, the NES class used to have
a DataBus object instance; but when I learned that I could not replace it w/ my debugger databus without causing subtle errors, I decided to 
replace it w/ a pointer which did allow me to replace it w/ my debugger w/o any errors.
