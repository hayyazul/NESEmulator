Controls: Arrow keys correspond to D-Pad, W is Start, Q is Select, S is the B button, and A is the A button.

This is an emulator for the NES I wrote during my freshman year. The goal is to reproduce the behavior of the NES at a cyclic level.
Two of the three main components of the NES were emulated, the CPU (a 6502 derivative), and the PPU (the graphics card; like a primordial GPU).
This taught me systems-level programming, working with low level concepts, and software engineering skills. I had to study NES documentation and functionality, a lot of which was unobvious.
